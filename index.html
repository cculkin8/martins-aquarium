					<p><b>Henry</b> is my most prized fish, they are truly a beauty. Big and strong I caught them off the cost of key west, and they haven't left my Aquarium since then. Often times I feed them blocks of cheddar cheese. If you wish to learn more about Henry or any of their friends, click on the image and it will take you to a quick video of the fish.</p>

				<h3>My favorite locations</h3>
				<article>
					<h4>Key West, Florida</h4>
					<p>Key West is where my I start my fishing season. Though it may be open from May all the way to December to fish, in my experience you'll have the best luck in the beginning of May. Henry, my magnificent Grouper, was caught May of 2018 there.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Panama</h4>
					<p>Panama is a beautiful location to harvest in the summer months, I have personally had great luck finding beautiful Wahoo Tuna there. My lovely Chunky was caught June of 2020 there!</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Belize</h4>
					<p>Belize is one of the best places to fish in the world; there is a great and hungry population of interesting fish year round to harvest. You'll find the best specimen midsummer to late fall, Trent the Tarpon was found there July of 2019.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Prince Edward Island, Canada</h4>
					<p>Prince Edward Island, (Canada's smallest province by both size and population,) is a great place to harvest respectable sized bluefin tuna. It's my recommendation top go fishing from August to November to get the best harvests. </p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h4>Montauk, New York</h4>
					<p>Montauk, (often called The End of The World by its residents,) is a great place to find Bluefish from September to October; I caught my world famous Eagle there!</p>
